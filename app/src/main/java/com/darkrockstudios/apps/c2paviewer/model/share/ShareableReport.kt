 * and builds this; the renderer only paints. Keeping it pure leaves the upper layers KMP-clean.
 *
 * The panel leads with the content **origin** (what the photo is — AI-generated, camera capture, …)
 * and demotes the signing/trust verdict to a secondary line, mirroring the on-screen summary card.
 * When the asset declares no recognised origin, the headline falls back to the trust verdict
 * ([headlineStyle] is then null and [trustLabel] is null, since the hero already is the verdict).
